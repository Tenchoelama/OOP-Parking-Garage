## OOP Parking Garage Project

### - The Garage class has methods to take a ticket, pay for parking, leave the garage, and calculate parking fees based on the duration of stay.
### - It keeps track of the number of parking spaces available and the number of taken spaces.
### - It uses a list of tickets and a dictionary of current tickets to keep track of tickets issued and their corresponding entry times.
### - The Main class uses the Garage class and presents the user with a menu to choose from to interact with the parking garage.
### - The parking fee is calculated based on the duration of stay and displayed to the user. The user can pay for the ticket or leave without paying.
### - If the user does not pay for the ticket before leaving, the program prompts them to pay before exiting the garage.
### - The program also displays the garage rates for different durations of stay.

### Language - Python
